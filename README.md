## Community

This project could be expanded and improved in many ways! Unfortunately my time for a "practice project" is somewhat limited, so I had to draw the line somewhere. I would love to see this project move forward if there is interest to collaborate. For instance, some of the social features are not yet fully implemented on the backend because of time constraints.
